Subject: [PATCH] handle ServerboundKeepAlivePacket async

In 1.12.2, Mojang moved the processing of ServerboundKeepAlivePacket off the main
thread, while entirely correct for the server, this causes issues with
plugins which are expecting the PlayerQuitEvent on the main thread.

In order to counteract some bad behavior, we will post handling of the
disconnection to the main thread, but leave the actual processing of the packet
off the main thread.

also adding some additional logging in order to help work out what is causing
random disconnections for clients.
