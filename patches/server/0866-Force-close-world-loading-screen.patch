Subject: [PATCH] Force close world loading screen

Dead players would be stuck in the world loading screen and other players may
miss messages and similar sent in the join event if chunk loading is slow.
Paper already circumvents falling through the world before chunks are loaded,
so we do not need that. The client only needs the chunk it is currently in to
be loaded to close the loading screen, so we just send an empty one.
