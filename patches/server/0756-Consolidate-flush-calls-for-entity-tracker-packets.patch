Subject: [PATCH] Consolidate flush calls for entity tracker packets

Most server packets seem to be sent from here, so try to avoid
expensive flush calls from them.

This change was motivated due to local testing:

- My server spawn has 130 cows in it (for testing a prev. patch)
- Try to let 200 players join spawn

Without this change, I could only get 20 players on before they
all started timing out due to the load put on the Netty I/O threads.

With this change I could get all 200 on at 0ms ping.

(one of the primary issues is that my CPU is kinda trash, and having
4 extra threads at 100% is just too much for it).

So in general this patch should reduce Netty I/O thread load.
