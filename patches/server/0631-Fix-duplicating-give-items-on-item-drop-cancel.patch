Subject: [PATCH] Fix duplicating /give items on item drop cancel

Fixes SPIGOT-2942 (Give command fires PlayerDropItemEvent, cancelling it causes item duplication).

For every stack of items to give, /give puts the item stack straight
into the player's inventory. However, it also summons a "fake item"
at the player's location. When the PlayerDropItemEvent for this fake
item is cancelled, the server attempts to put the item back into the
player's inventory. The result is that the fake item, which is never
meant to be obtained, is combined with the real items injected directly
into the player's inventory. This means more items than the amount
specified in /give are given to the player - one for every stack of
items given. (e.g. /give @s dirt 1 gives you 2 dirt).

While this isn't a big issue for general building usage, it can affect
e.g. adventure maps where the number of items the player receives is
important (and you want to restrict the player from throwing items).

If there are any overflow items that didn't make it into the inventory
(insufficient space), those items are dropped as a real item instead
of a fake one. While cancelling this drop would also result in the
server attempting to put those items into the inventory, since it is
full this has no effect.

Just ignoring cancellation of the PlayerDropItemEvent seems like the
cleanest and least intrusive way to fix it.
